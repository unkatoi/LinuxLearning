# Syntax

## **'#'** character: 

   - ### This character is used to create a heading **the more '#' you add the smaller it gets**
   
        - #### Name + Number of '#'
        
        - # Title1
        
            - ## Title2    
            
                - ### Title3
                
                    - #### Title4
                    
                        - ##### Title5
                        
                            - ###### Title6   
                            
                            > Note: cannot do the following: `####### Title7`. Since the maximum number is 6.
                            >
                            > That's how the title is done: `# Heading`

## The '*' or '_' characters

   ### Both of these characters have the same usage which is the following:

   1. Can be used for *italic* text format which is done as follows:

          *Italic* 
              
   - OR

         _Italic_
              
        - In each case the result is _Italic_
        
        -      -      -      -
        
   2. Can be used for **bold** text format which is done as follows:

          **Bold** 
              
   - OR

         __Bold__
              
   - In each case the result is __Italic__

        - - - - -

   3. Can be used for ***Bold + Italic*** text format which is done as follows:

          ***Bold + Italic*** 
              
   - OR

         ___Bold + Italic___
              
   - In each case the result is ___Bold + Italic___

        ----
        
   4. Can be used for **All Bold + Part _Italic_** text format which is done as follows:

          **All Bold + Part _Italic_** 
              
   - OR

         __All Bold + Part *Italic*__
                
   - OR

         **All Bold + Part *Italic*** / __All Bold + Part _Italic___
              
   - In each case the result is __All Bold + Part *Italic*__

### Notes:

   > 1. It's recommended to use `*` instead of `_` . However, there are exceptions such as the number 4 above.
   >
   > 2. In order to write one new line you just have to press the `enter` or `return` key on your keyboard **twice**.
   > So that there is a blank line in between.
   >                       
   >        First line
   >
   >        Second line
   >       
   > 3. It's also recommended to use a blanked line in between each new line even if there is a special character that does a new line for you
   >
   >   **Example:**
   >
   >       1. First line
   >       2. Second line
   >
   >   Has the same result as the one bellow:
   >       
   >       1. First line
   >
   >       2. Second line
   >
   >   Result:
   >
   >   1. First line
   >   2. Second line
   >
   >   However, it's better to use the one with a blank in between. Since, it's more organized than the first.
   >
   > 4. Also add a space after using a special character. Moreover, if you run out of space in one line press enter`enter` or `return` key on
   >  your keyboard **once**, so it will remain on one line on the observer's view.
   >
   >   Example:
   >
   >           Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text 
   >           Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text 
   >           Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text 
   >           Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text 
   >   
   >   Results in: 
   >   
   >   Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text 
   >   Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text 
   >   Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text 
   >   Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text Some long text
