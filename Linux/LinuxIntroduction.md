# Introduction

## GNU

### Is an operating system that was created for the soul purpose of being a Free Software[^1]. They aimed for an operating system that includes everything that comes with UNIX.


## Linux

### It's a kernel[^2] that was created by someone other than the one who created GNU. 

> ### At that time GNU lacked a kernel while the other components were almost completed. Therefore, Linux's creator combined his kernel with GNU in order to create a full operating system.
>
> ### Therefore, some people refer to the operating system as GNU while most people know the OS as Linux.

## Linux Distributions

### Combines between the GNU tools and the Linux kernel. Also each distribution offers it's own desktop environment, package manager..

## Shell

### It's an improtant part of an OS. 

### It takes user's commands and transfers them to the operating system to perform.

> ### It's called a shell, because it's the outer layer of an OS. Like the shell around an oyster.

## Terminal

### Is a program (software application) that runs a shell where we type our commands.

### The commands that we type in the terminal are interpreted to the OS by a Shell. 

> ### Shells: Bash[^4], Fish, ZSH for mac. There are other shells.
